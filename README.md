# Docker of a photo gallery : Lychee
------

To start please git clone my repository with the *--recursive* option (to get the needed submodule) : 
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/Krysthalia/tp-docker.git`

Then launch the docker : 
`docker-compose up`

You can go to the http://localhost:8080/ address to see the result.
The database host is *mysql-server*, the user is *root* and the password *password*.
Then choose your logins.
